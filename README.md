# Serverless Google Cloud Function with Spring Boot

This repository contains a serverless application built using Google Cloud Functions and Spring Boot framework. The application is designed to run as a serverless function on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It showcases how to build and deploy a serverless API endpoint using Spring Boot with Google Cloud Functions.

## Overview

The serverless application architecture includes the following components:

1. **Google Cloud Functions**: Serverless functions that are triggered by HTTP requests.
2. **Spring Boot Application**: RESTful API endpoints implemented using Spring Boot.
3. **Event Handling**: Logic to handle incoming HTTP requests, process data, and generate responses.
